PreprocessedTerminal -> TerminalContainer -> main.qml


## PreprocessedTerminal

This _should_ be where the video logic is handled. (Right now it's in main)


## TerminalContainer

## TODO

- ensure original authors work is honored.
- Readme
- dist packages
- screenshots
- icons
- windows test

## Ideas

- Make volume green numbers on the corner of the screen like on old tv's

- make channel dial with loud "clack" noise that switches between preset channels.

- Allow to enter url to stream
